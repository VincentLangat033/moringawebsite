I am the major contributor to the coding of this page implementing the knowledge I gained during my first week here at Moringa
This project, I believe aims to test my knowledge and implementation of basic HTML and CSS structures and how they can be integral in developing a website.
The set-up instructions for this website are easy to locate as I havent encrypted any of the files and I'll be hosting it on gh-pages and the link is attached as below https://vincentlangat033.github.io/moringawebsite/
The technologies used mostly is CSS and HTML.
Future features to include are but not limited to PHP, Bootstrap and Javascript; I believe this features will increase the responsiveness of my webpage.
The bugs I found are the failing link to my gh-pages as it cannot load all the changes I made in my local repository.
I will be available to be contacted via email at kimutailangat033@gmail.com, also via phone on +254723753014
this is an open-source license and everyone can access the code for development and learning purposes.
